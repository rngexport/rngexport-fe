        "content": "Three critical parameters define cottonization yield: inlet moisture (8–12%), drum speed and aspiration flow. Sensor-based density control keeps the line stable and trims energy use.",
        "long_content": "In industrial hemp processing facilities, the most critical way to increase efficiency is to standardize the quality of the material entering the cottonization line. Our field experience at RNG Export shows that capacity increases of up to 30% are achieved not just by increasing machine speed, but by optimizing the process.\n\nRule One: Inlet Moisture. The moisture content of the fiber entering the cottonization unit must be between 8% and 12%. Fiber that is too dry breaks and turns into dust; fiber that is too moist wraps around drums and causes blockages. We use sensors that continuously measure moisture at the line inlet and automatic humidification units to maintain this balance.\n\nRule Two: Drum Speed and Blade Geometry. Every hemp variety is different. Drum revolutions per minute (RPM) must be dynamically adjustable via PLC according to fiber strength. On RNG Export lines, operators can optimize machine settings in seconds by running recipe-based production during raw material changes.\n\nRule Three: Aspiration Flow. Removing micro-dust and short fibers released during cottonization is vital for both product quality and ATEX safety. Insufficient suction causes fibers to re-agglomerate (nep formation). RNG Export aspiration units save energy and offer maximum cleaning by adjusting flow rates as needed thanks to frequency inverter fans.",

        "content": "Biggest loss in flax lines is fiber breakage and shive density fluctuation. Low-torque openers, fine shaker screening and automatic bale pressing deliver homogeneous density.",
        "long_content": "Setting up a flax processing plant requires integrated process engineering, not just lining up machines. Every step from the arrival of bales from the field to the shipment of processed fiber must be planned.\n\n1. Decortication (Stalk Breaking and Pre-Opening): Separating the woody part (shive) of the flax stalk from the fiber begins with a mechanical breaking process. The critical part here is to break the woody part without shortening the fiber length. RNG Export's KENEVA series openers ensure maximum shive separation without damaging the fiber thanks to special blade angles.\n\n2. Fine Cleaning (Scutching & Shaking): Multi-deck shaker systems are used to clean remaining small woody particles. Thanks to our anti-blinding technology, screens remain continuously open and cleaning efficiency does not drop.\n\n3. ATEX and Safety: Flax dust is highly flammable. The facility's aspiration system and electrical panels must comply with ATEX standards. RNG Export offers spark detection and automatic suppression systems as standard.\n\n4. Logistics and Baling: Processed flax fiber is voluminous. High-density bale presses are used to reduce transport costs. Our fully automatic presses speed up your logistics operation by working with a capacity of up to 5 tons per hour.",

        "content": "With low-speed controlled drums and anti-blinding shakers, fiber integrity is preserved, tensile strength rises, and biocomposites gain better surface quality.",
        "long_content": "The automotive industry is turning to natural fibers instead of glass fiber to reduce vehicle weight and carbon footprint. Flax and hemp are the strongest candidates with their high strength-to-weight ratio. However, the fiber to be used in composite production must meet certain standards.\n\nFiber Length: The main factor providing strength in composite materials is fiber length. RNG Export's long fiber lines process fibers between 6-40 cm while preserving them. By avoiding aggressive openers, the natural structure of the fiber is not disrupted.\n\nMetal and Foreign Matter: A metal particle in injection or pressing molds can lead to disaster. Therefore, our lines feature multi-stage magnetic detectors and metal separators. We guarantee 100% metal-free fiber.\n\nHomogeneity: In composite part production, the fiber must be distributed evenly within the mold. Our KOTONEX technology prevents clumping by individualizing fibers and facilitates resin impregnation.\n\nDoor panels, dashboard bodies, and interior trim parts produced with this technology possess both lightweight and impact-absorbing properties.",

        "content": "Fine dust and metal particles reduce both quality and safety. The right cyclone, bag filter, and VFD fan combo is critical.",
        "long_content": "Dust management in hemp processing is as much about safety (ATEX) as it is about product quality. Key principles we use at RNG Export:\n\n1) Multi-Stage Aspiration: Separate aspiration after bale opening, decortication, and cottonization. Dust and short fibers are captured at the source, not returned to the line.\n\n2) Sensor-Based Flow Control: VFD-driven fans adjust airflow to line load. This lowers energy use and prevents filter overload.\n\n3) Cyclone + Bag Filter: Cyclone captures heavy particles; bag filter traps fine dust. ATEX safety valves and spark detection modules minimize fire risk.\n\n4) Metal Separation: Magnetic detectors and separators reduce metal risk in dust, protecting knives and ensuring product safety.",

        "long_content": "In flax fiber production, fluctuating quality raises rejection risk. RNG Export lines monitor key metrics:\n\n1) Moisture Management: Online sensors keep 8–12% band. Over-dry fiber creates dust; over-wet fiber wraps drums. Humidification/drying adjusts per recipe.\n\n2) Shive Control: After shaker + aspiration, shive ratio is measured inline. If out of band, line speed and airflow self-optimize.\n\n3) Metal & Foreign Matter: Multi-stage magnets and metal separators improve machine life and product safety—protecting card wires and blades.\n\n4) Recipe-Based Production: Operators pick predefined recipes per raw material source.

Our approach:\n\n1) Multi-Stage Magnets: At bale opener and decorticator outlets; second stage before card wires and drums.\n\n2) Metal Separator: Inline in aspiration; sensor-driven ejection removes metal from flow.\n\n3) Sensor & Alarm: When metal density crosses threshold, line speed is reduced and operators are alerted to check knives.\n\n4) Spark Risk: Metal + dust increases spark risk; ATEX valves and spark detection modules are integrated.",

    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What products are obtained with flax processing machines?",
      "answer": "Long fiber, short fiber, cottonized fiber and biocomposite raw materials are produced from flax and hemp."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What lines are found in a turnkey fiber plant?",
      "answer": "It includes bale opening, decorticator, aspiration, cottonization, long fiber line, drying, pressing and automation integration."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What is the difference between flax and hemp processing machines?",
      "answer": "Flax fibers are finer and more delicate, requiring lower speeds and gentler openers. Hemp is tougher and needs higher crushing power in the decorticator. RNG Export lines offer the flexibility to process both products on a single line thanks to inverter-controlled motors and interchangeable knife sets."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What is the cost of a turnkey fiber plant installation?",
      "answer": "The cost varies depending on capacity (tons/hour), automation level, and selected machine configuration. We offer scalable solutions ranging from 1 ton/hour starter lines to 5 ton/hour fully automated integrated facilities. You can contact our engineers for detailed feasibility and price offers."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "How is decorticator machine efficiency measured?",
      "answer": "Decorticator efficiency is measured by the ratio of woody parts (shives) separated without fiber loss. A good decorticator should provide 80-90% cleaning without breaking the fiber. RNG Export decorticators offer minimum fiber loss and maximum cleaning with adjustable knife angles and an optimized feeding system."
