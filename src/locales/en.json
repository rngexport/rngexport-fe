        "content": "Three critical parameters define cottonization yield: inlet moisture (8–12%), drum speed and aspiration flow. Sensor-based density control keeps the line stable and trims energy use.",
        "long_content": "In industrial hemp processing facilities, the most critical way to increase efficiency is to standardize the quality of the material entering the cottonization line. Our field experience at RNG Export shows that capacity increases of up to 30% are achieved not just by increasing machine speed, but by optimizing the process.\n\nRule One: Inlet Moisture. The moisture content of the fiber entering the cottonization unit must be between 8% and 12%. Fiber that is too dry breaks and turns into dust; fiber that is too moist wraps around drums and causes blockages. We use sensors that continuously measure moisture at the line inlet and automatic humidification units to maintain this balance.\n\nRule Two: Drum Speed and Blade Geometry. Every hemp variety is different. Drum revolutions per minute (RPM) must be dynamically adjustable via PLC according to fiber strength. On RNG Export lines, operators can optimize machine settings in seconds by running recipe-based production during raw material changes.\n\nRule Three: Aspiration Flow. Removing micro-dust and short fibers released during cottonization is vital for both product quality and ATEX safety. Insufficient suction causes fibers to re-agglomerate (nep formation). RNG Export aspiration units save energy and offer maximum cleaning by adjusting flow rates as needed thanks to frequency inverter fans.",

        "content": "Biggest loss in flax lines is fiber breakage and shive density fluctuation. Low-torque openers, fine shaker screening and automatic bale pressing deliver homogeneous density.",
        "long_content": "Setting up a flax processing plant requires integrated process engineering, not just lining up machines. Every step from the arrival of bales from the field to the shipment of processed fiber must be planned.\n\n1. Decortication (Stalk Breaking and Pre-Opening): Separating the woody part (shive) of the flax stalk from the fiber begins with a mechanical breaking process. The critical part here is to break the woody part without shortening the fiber length. RNG Export's KENEVA series openers ensure maximum shive separation without damaging the fiber thanks to special blade angles.\n\n2. Fine Cleaning (Scutching & Shaking): Multi-deck shaker systems are used to clean remaining small woody particles. Thanks to our anti-blinding technology, screens remain continuously open and cleaning efficiency does not drop.\n\n3. ATEX and Safety: Flax dust is highly flammable. The facility's aspiration system and electrical panels must comply with ATEX standards. RNG Export offers spark detection and automatic suppression systems as standard.\n\n4.

        "long_content": "The automotive industry is turning to natural fibers instead of glass fiber to reduce vehicle weight and carbon footprint. Flax and hemp are the strongest candidates with their high strength-to-weight ratio. However, the fiber to be used in composite production must meet certain standards.\n\nFiber Length: The main factor providing strength in composite materials is fiber length. RNG Export's long fiber lines process fibers between 6-40 cm while preserving them. By avoiding aggressive openers, the natural structure of the fiber is not disrupted.\n\nMetal and Foreign Matter: A metal particle in injection or pressing molds can lead to disaster. Therefore, our lines feature multi-stage magnetic detectors and metal separators. We guarantee 100% metal-free fiber.\n\nHomogeneity: In composite part production, the fiber must be distributed evenly within the mold. Our KOTONEX technology prevents clumping by individualizing fibers and facilitates resin impregnation.\n\nDoor panels, dashboard bodies, and interior trim parts produced with this technology possess both lightweight and impact-absorbing properties.",

        "long_content": "Hemp processing line installation is a complex process that transforms raw bales from the field into industrial-grade fiber. RNG Export's 20 years of experience shows that successful installations follow a specific methodology.\n\n1. SPACE PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nFactory space calculation: Minimum 800 m² for 1 ton/hour capacity, 2500 m² for 5 ton/hour. Minimum height of 6 meters is critical. Bale storage area should be 1.5 times the line length.\n\nElectrical infrastructure: Hemp processing lines consume high power. 150-200 kW for 1 ton/hour, 600-800 kW for 5 ton/hour. ATEX-compliant electrical panels and grounding system are mandatory.\n\n2. MACHINE SELECTION AND CONFIGURATION\n\nBale opening unit: Automatic bale feeding, metal detector, and pre-cleaning units should be standard. RNG Export's RODI series operates up to 5 tons/hour capacity.\n\nDecorticator selection: Blade angle and RPM should be adjustable based on hemp stalk hardness. KENEVA series decorticators provide flexible production with inverter-controlled motors.\n\nCottonization line: Number of drums, blade geometry, and aspiration flow rate directly affect product quality. RNG Export lines can process different hemp varieties with recipe-based automation.\n\n3. ATEX AND SAFETY\n\nDust explosion risk: Hemp dust is highly flammable. All aspiration systems must be ATEX Zone 22 compliant. Spark detection and automatic suppression systems are mandatory.\n\nElectrical safety: All motors and electrical panels must be IP65 protection class and ATEX certified. RNG Export designs all systems according to ATEX standards.\n\n4. OPERATIONAL READINESS\n\nOperator training: Machine operators must be trained on PLC interface, recipe management, and emergency procedures. RNG Export provides 5 days of operator training with every installation.\n\nMaintenance planning: Preventive maintenance program extends machine life and prevents unplanned downtime. Blade replacement, filter cleaning, and lubrication schedules are critical.\n\n5. QUALITY CONTROL AND TESTING\n\nInitial production tests: 72-hour continuous test production should be performed after installation.

        "long_content": "Flax fiber production requires a more delicate process than hemp. Flax fibers are finer and more brittle, so aggressive processing techniques should be avoided. RNG Export's flax lines maintain fiber integrity while maximizing efficiency.\n\n1. STALK BREAKING AND DECORTICATION\n\nLow-speed openers: In flax stalk breaking, woody parts (shives) must be separated without damaging the fiber. RNG Export's KENEVA series openers operate at 400-600 RPM range to preserve fiber length.\n\nBlade angle optimization: Specially designed blade angles for flax minimize fiber breakage. Operators can adjust blade angle via PLC based on raw material quality.\n\n2. FIBER PROTECTION AND LENGTH MANAGEMENT\n\nLong fiber line: Preservation of 6-40 cm long fibers is critical for composite and textile applications. RNG Export's long fiber lines preserve fiber integrity with low-speed drums and anti-blinding shaker systems.\n\nShort fiber separation: Short fibers (2-6 cm) are directed to cottonization line. This way both long and short fibers are utilized and waste is minimized.\n\n3. SHIVE SEPARATION AND CLEANING\n\nMulti-stage shaker systems: 3-5 stage shaker systems are used to clean remaining small woody particles (shives). Anti-blinding technology keeps screens continuously open.\n\nAspiration optimization: Separate aspiration units at each stage capture shives and dust at source. VFD fans adjust flow rate based on line load.\n\n4. MOISTURE MANAGEMENT\n\nTarget moisture band: Ideal moisture content for flax fiber is 8-12%. Too dry fiber produces dust, too moist fiber wraps around drums and causes blockages.\n\nOnline moisture sensors: Moisture sensors placed along the line provide continuous measurement. Humidification/drying units activate automatically.\n\n5. QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDIZATION\n\nInline measurements: Shive ratio, moisture, metal contamination, and fiber length are continuously measured. When outside target band, line speed and machine settings are automatically optimized.\n\nRecipe-based production: Pre-defined recipes for different flax varieties are used. This maintains quality standard while reducing changeover time.\n\n6. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\nVFD-controlled motors: All drive motors operate with frequency inverters. Speed adjustment based on line load reduces energy consumption by 15-20%.\n\nSmart aspiration: Fan speed is automatically adjusted based on filter differential pressure. Unnecessary high flow is prevented, energy is saved.",

        "content": "The decorticator is the heart of hemp and flax processing lines. Correct decorticator selection determines both product quality and line efficiency.",
        "long_content": "The decorticator machine is a critical unit that separates the woody part (shive) of hemp and flax stalks from the fiber. Wrong selection leads to fiber loss, low quality, and high maintenance costs. This RNG Export guide covers critical criteria for correct decorticator selection.\n\n1. CAPACITY CALCULATION\n\nHourly capacity: Decorticator capacity determines the total line capacity. 800-1000 kg/hour decorticator capacity is required for 1 ton/hour raw bale. RNG Export decorticators scale from 500 kg/hour to 5 tons/hour.\n\nContinuity factor: There can be a 20-30% difference between theoretical and actual capacity. Raw material quality, moisture content, and maintenance downtime create this difference. 30% reserve should be left for safe capacity selection.\n\n2. BLADE SYSTEM AND ADJUSTABILITY\n\nBlade angle: 15-25° for hemp, 10-18° for flax is optimal. Adjustable blade angle provides flexibility to process different raw material qualities.\n\nNumber and arrangement of blades: Multi-blade systems provide more homogeneous separation but consume more energy. RNG Export decorticators come with 8-16 blade configurations.\n\nBlade change ease: Quick blade replacement shortens maintenance time. RNG Export's modular blade system enables 30-minute blade change.\n\n3. MOTOR POWER AND DRIVE SYSTEM\n\nPower requirement: 30-40 kW motor power is required for 1 ton/hour capacity. Hemp requires higher power than flax. RNG Export decorticators come with inverter-controlled motors.\n\nSoft start: Inverter-controlled motors provide soft start. This prevents load on electrical grid and extends machine life.\n\n4. RAW MATERIAL COMPATIBILITY\n\nHemp vs Flax: Hemp is harder, requires higher crushing power. Flax is more delicate, requires lower RPM and gentle processing. RNG Export decorticators have flexibility to process both products.\n\nMoisture tolerance: Moisture content of raw material entering decorticator should be 8-15%. Too dry material causes fiber breakage, too moist material causes blockages.\n\n5. CLEANING EFFICIENCY AND FIBER LOSS\n\nShive separation ratio: A good decorticator should provide 80-90% shive separation without breaking the fiber. RNG Export decorticators offer maximum cleaning with minimum fiber loss thanks to optimized blade geometry.\n\nFiber length preservation: For long fiber applications, preserving fiber length is critical. Low-speed, adjustable blade angle systems should be preferred.\n\n6. MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE\n\nAccessibility: Easy access to blades, screens, and drive systems shortens maintenance time. RNG Export decorticators enable quick maintenance thanks to modular design.\n\nSpare parts supply time: Quick supply of critical spare parts (blades, screens, bearings) is important. RNG Export keeps all spare parts in stock.\n\n7. AUTOMATION AND CONTROL\n\nPLC integration: Decorticator should be integrable to line automation. Speed, blade angle, and feed rate should be controllable via PLC.\n\nRecipe management: Pre-defined recipes for different raw material types enable quick changeover. RNG Export's recipe system minimizes operator errors.",

RNG Export's 20 years of experience has enabled development of flexible systems that can process both products on a single line. This comparison details technical differences and common points.\n\n1. FIBER PROPERTIES AND PROCESSING DIFFICULTY\n\nHemp: Has harder and more durable fiber structure. Average fiber length is 1-5 meters. Has higher strength/weight ratio but is harder to process.\n\nFlax: Has finer and more delicate fiber structure. Average fiber length is 30-90 cm. Easier to process but brittle, aggressive processing techniques should be avoided.\n\n2. DECORTICATOR DIFFERENCES\n\nRPM: 600-900 RPM for hemp, 400-600 RPM for flax is optimal. High RPM for flax leads to fiber breakage.\n\nBlade angles: 15-25° for hemp, 10-18° blade angle is used. Smaller angle for flax is critical for fiber protection.\n\nMotor power: 40-50 kW for 1 ton/hour capacity for hemp, 30-40 kW for flax. Hemp requires higher crushing power.\n\n3. COTTONIZATION DIFFERENCES\n\nDrum speed: 800-1200 RPM for hemp, 600-900 RPM for flax is optimal. High speed for flax causes fiber breakage.\n\nBlade geometry: More aggressive blade geometry for hemp, gentler angles for flax. RNG Export's adjustable blade systems can process both products.\n\nAspiration flow rate: Hemp produces more dust, so higher aspiration flow rate is required. Lower flow is sufficient for flax.\n\n4. MOISTURE MANAGEMENT\n\nTarget moisture band: 8-12% moisture is optimal for both products but flax requires narrower band (9-11%). Moisture control is more critical for flax.\n\nDrying time: Hemp has higher moisture tolerance. Drying for flax must be more delicate, over-drying reduces fiber quality.\n\n5. CLEANING AND QUALITY CONTROL\n\nShive separation: 85-90% for hemp, 80-85% for flax is targeted. Flax produces finer shives, cleaning is more difficult.\n\nMetal detection: Multi-stage metal detectors are critical for both products. More sensitive detectors are required for flax because even small metal particles reduce fiber quality.\n\n6. ENERGY CONSUMPTION\n\nTotal power: Hemp lines consume higher power (200-250 kW for 1 ton/hour), flax lines lower (150-200 kW for 1 ton/hour). Difference comes from power requirements in decorticator and cottonization units.\n\nInverter optimization: VFD-controlled motors are critical for both lines. Inverter optimization provides greater energy savings in flax lines because they operate at lower speeds.\n\n7. MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE\n\nBlade life: Blade life is shorter for hemp (300-500 hours), longer for flax (500-800 hours). Hemp is harder material so blade wear is higher.\n\nFilter cleaning: Hemp produces more dust, filter cleaning must be done more frequently. Less dust is produced for flax but filter selection is critical because dust is finer.\n\n8. FLEXIBILITY FOR PROCESSING ON SINGLE LINE\n\nRNG Export's hybrid lines: Thanks to adjustable blade angles, inverter-controlled motors, and recipe-based automation, the same line can process both hemp and flax. Changeover time is 2-4 hours.\n\nRecipe management: Operators select pre-defined recipes based on raw material type. PLC automatically optimizes machine settings.

        "content": "Flax stalk processing requires separation of fiber from woody part (shive). Correct technology selection determines both fiber quality and efficiency.",
        "long_content": "Flax stalk processing is the first and most critical stage of flax fiber production. Flax stalks from the field are processed to separate woody part (shive) from fiber. During this process, fiber integrity must be preserved and maximum shive separation must be achieved. RNG Export's flax stalk processing technologies optimize these goals.\n\n1. FLAX STALK PROPERTIES\n\nStructure: Flax stalk consists of outer fiber layer and inner woody part (shive). Fibers are arranged longitudinally on outer surface of stalk. Average stalk diameter 1-3 mm, length 60-120 cm.\n\nMoisture content: Moisture content of flax stalk after harvest is 12-18%. Must be reduced to 8-12% before processing. Too dry stalk causes fiber breakage.\n\n2. DECORTICATION PROCESS\n\nPre-breaking: Flax stalks first pass through low-speed breakers for pre-processing. At this stage, stalk structure is loosened but fiber integrity is preserved. RNG Export's pre-breaking units operate at 300-400 RPM range.\n\nMain decortication: After pre-breaking, stalks are fed to main decorticator. At this stage, shive is separated from fiber. Specially designed blade angles (10-18°) and low speed (400-600 RPM) for flax are used.\n\nBlade geometry: Special blade geometry for flax breaks shive without damaging fiber. Blade angle must be adjustable because different flax varieties require different angles.\n\n3. SHIVE SEPARATION TECHNOLOGIES\n\nShaker systems: Remaining small shive particles after decortication are cleaned with multi-stage shaker (vibrating) systems. 3-5 stage shaker systems separate shive particles of different sizes.\n\nAnti-blinding technology: Flax dust can clog screens (blinding). RNG Export's anti-blinding technology keeps screens continuously open. This way cleaning efficiency does not drop.\n\nAspiration: Separate aspiration units at each stage capture shives and dust at source. VFD fans adjust flow rate based on line load.\n\n4. FIBER LENGTH PRESERVATION\n\nLow-speed processing: Flax fibers are brittle, aggressive processing techniques should be avoided. Low-speed drums (400-600 RPM) and gentle blade angles preserve fiber length.\n\nLong fiber line: 6-40 cm long fibers are directed to special long fiber line. This line preserves fiber integrity with low-speed drums and anti-blinding shaker systems.\n\nShort fiber utilization: 2-6 cm short fibers are directed to cottonization line. This way both long and short fibers are utilized and waste is minimized.\n\n5. DUST MANAGEMENT AND ATEX\n\nDust production: Fine dust is released during flax processing. This dust creates both health and safety risks. ATEX Zone 22 compliant aspiration systems are mandatory.\n\nSpark detection: Flax dust is flammable. Spark detection and automatic suppression systems minimize fire risk. RNG Export designs all systems according to ATEX standards.\n\nFilter selection: Flax dust is very fine, requires special filters. Bag filters capture dust with 99.9%+ efficiency.\n\n6. MOISTURE MANAGEMENT\n\nTarget moisture band: Ideal moisture content for flax stalk processing is 8-12%. Too dry stalk causes fiber breakage. Too moist stalk wraps around drums and causes blockages.\n\nOnline moisture sensors: Moisture sensors placed along the line provide continuous measurement. Humidification/drying units activate automatically.\n\n7. QUALITY CONTROL\n\nShive ratio measurement: Shive ratio in processed fiber must be continuously measured. Target: below 5% shive. High shive ratio reduces product quality.\n\nFiber length analysis: Fiber length is critical for long fiber applications. Online measurement systems continuously monitor fiber length.\n\nMetal contamination: Metal particles reduce both machine life and product quality. Multi-stage magnetic detectors are mandatory.\n\n8. EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION\n\nCapacity: Flax stalk processing line capacity is determined by decorticator capacity. 800-1000 kg/hour decorticator capacity is required for 1 ton/hour raw stalk.\n\nEnergy optimization: VFD-controlled motors reduce energy consumption by 15-20% by adjusting speed based on line load.\n\nRecipe-based production: Pre-defined recipes for different flax varieties enable quick changeover and optimal quality.",

Hemp requires special design because it has harder structure than flax. RNG Export's KENEVA series peeling machines are optimized for hemp processing.\n\n1. HEMP PEELING MACHINE OPERATING PRINCIPLE\n\nMechanical separation: Hemp stalk contacts blades on rotating drums. Blades separate outer fiber layer from inner woody part. This operation must be done preserving fiber integrity.\n\nBlade angle: Optimal blade angle for hemp is 15-25°. This angle provides maximum separation without damaging fiber. Adjustable blade angle provides flexibility to process different hemp varieties.\n\nRPM: Optimal RPM for hemp peeling is 600-900. High RPM causes fiber breakage. Low RPM causes insufficient separation.\n\n2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nCapacity: RNG Export's KENEVA series peeling machines are produced in capacities from 500 kg/hour to 5 tons/hour. Capacity selection should be made based on total line capacity.\n\nMotor power: 40-50 kW motor power is required for 1 ton/hour capacity. Hemp requires higher power than flax. Inverter-controlled motors provide soft start and energy savings.\n\nNumber of blades: Configurations with 8-16 blades available. Multi-blade systems provide more homogeneous separation but consume more energy.\n\nDrum diameter: Drum diameters from 600-1200 mm available. Large drum provides higher capacity but requires higher power.\n\n3. BLADE SYSTEM\n\nBlade material: High carbon steel or carbide-coated blades used. Blade wear is high because hemp is hard material. Carbide-coated blades extend life 2-3 times.\n\nBlade replacement: Thanks to modular blade system, blades can be quickly replaced. Blade change time: 30-45 minutes.\n\nBlade angle adjustment: Blade angle can be adjusted via PLC. This enables optimal setting for different hemp varieties.\n\n4. PROCESS INTEGRATION\n\nBale opening integration: Peeling machine is placed after bale opening unit. Automatic feeding system provides continuous production.\n\nAspiration integration: Dust and short fibers released during peeling are removed with aspiration system. Source capture principle prevents dust return to main line.\n\nMetal detection: Metal detectors before and after peeling prevent metal contamination. This preserves both machine life and product quality.\n\n5. QUALITY PARAMETERS\n\nFiber loss: A good peeling machine should provide maximum separation with minimum fiber loss. RNG Export's KENEVA series provides 85-90% separation with 3-5% fiber loss.\n\nFiber length preservation: Preserving fiber length is critical for long fiber applications. Optimized blade angles and low speed preserve fiber length.\n\nShive separation ratio: Shive ratio in processed fiber should be below 5%. High shive ratio reduces product quality.\n\n6. MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE\n\nPreventive maintenance: Blades should be replaced every 300-500 hours. Bearings should be checked every 2000 hours. Planned maintenance extends machine life.\n\nSpare parts supply: RNG Export keeps all spare parts in stock. Critical spare parts (blades, bearings, screens) can be supplied within 24 hours.\n\nTechnical support: 24/7 technical support line. Troubleshooting via PLC with remote access. Field service.\n\n7. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\nInverter optimization: VFD-controlled motors reduce energy consumption by 15-20% by adjusting speed based on line load.\n\nSmart feeding: Sensor-based feeding system adjusts machine speed based on line load. Idle operation prevented, energy saved.\n\n8. APPLICATION AREAS\n\nTextile fiber: Long hemp fibers used in textile industry. High-quality peeling preserves fiber length.\n\nComposite raw material: Short and long hemp fibers used in composite production. Homogeneous separation increases composite quality.\n\nConstruction materials: Hemp fibers used in natural insulation material production. Clean separation determines product quality.",
